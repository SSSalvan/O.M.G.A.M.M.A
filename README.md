-- Calamity Control --
A turn-based simulation game where you manage the development of Indonesian provinces. The goal is to increase development while keeping **population and carbon emissions under control**, using a combination of **strategic resource usage**, **random events**, and **mini-games**. Each week represents a new turn, presenting new opportunities and challenges.

This project was built in **Godot** as part of an academic game development project to apply principles of object-oriented modeling (OOM), game design, scripting, development, and lastly Software development. It emphasizes environmental awareness and sustainable growth in a gamified way.
